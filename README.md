# FOR THE IMPATIENT:

# How To Run:
--------------------------------
To import a new graph, access the input.txt file, then enter the number of vertices in your graph - maximum 999,  and the connections between the vertices․ And if you want to see the work directly, do the following steps.
Writing **make** the program will create the file *my_project* to enter the system you need to write **make run** for cleaning write **make clean**

>>  make
>>  make run

then 

>>  make clean

# Necessary tools:
--------------------------------
We need **UNIX** operating system, **g++**, **graphviz** , **feh** tools.

If you don't have this tools, you need to install with this commands
For **g++**

>> sudo apt install g++ 

For **graphviz**

>>  sudo apt install graphviz

For **feh**

>>  sudo apt install feh


# Terms:
--------------------------------
**Graph** a structure made of vertices and edges.
**Adjacency matrix** a matrix with rows and columns labeled by graph vertices, with a 1 or 0 in position according to whether and. are adjacent or not.
**Articulation points** a vertex whose removal from the graph increases its number of connected components.
